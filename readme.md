## Description üìú

Drop Shipping is becoming very popular and it's a great way to start a small business without owning a product line, a brand, or a manufacturing facility. The internet made this concept very easy and affordable. All you need is a webshop, a third-party supplier, and a delivery method. There are a lot of suppliers online as well, so you can easily order stock, ship orders, and put new products for sale with a few clicks and taps on your keyboard.

## About the project üß©

The shop we are looking for needs to have all the basic functionality of a webshop, including having an order system, listing products, a cart, and a form for the user to fill in their information so they could get their order. The orders should initially arrive at our email address. A payment system is not necessary, since the people will be paying when they get the delivery.
